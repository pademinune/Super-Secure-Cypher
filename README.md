# Super-Secure-Cypher
A message encryption and decryption program using a custom very, secure cypher.

If you want to decrypt a message, set 'Encrypt' to 'False', then run the program and enter the message you want to decrypt.
If you want to encrypt a message, set 'Encrypt' to 'True', then run the program and enter the message you want to encrypt.

Due to the nature of the cypher, there will be some ambigious outputs - different inputs can give the same output. Thus, the decryption algorithm may return multiple output messages (you have to guess which one was intended).
